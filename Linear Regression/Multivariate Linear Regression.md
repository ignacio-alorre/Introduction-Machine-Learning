# Multivariate Linear Regression

For this case we try to predict our output based on several features(variables) instead of just one. Going back to the example of the 
houses we have:

So for the previous example x2(4) would be 40.

Now our hypothesis would be:

Now the cost function would be

Now, let's compare the Gradient Descent for single variable and multivariable:
